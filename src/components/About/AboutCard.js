            Hi Everyone, I am <span className="purple">Celestine Okonkwo </span>
            from <span className="purple"> Anambra, Nigeria. </span>
            <br />
            I am currently employed as a data analysis intern at GoPro Integrated Technologies, Lagos.
            <br />
            I have currently pursuing a BSc. in Computer Science at Mountain Top University,
            Nigeria.
            <br />
            <br />
            Apart from coding and manipulating data, some other activities that I love to do are:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li className="about-activity">
              <ImPointRight /> Playing Games
            </li>
            <li className="about-activity">
              <ImPointRight /> Reading
            </li>
            <li className="about-activity">
              <ImPointRight /> Sleeping üòÇ
            </li>
          </ul>

            {/* "Whatever you do, work at it with all your heart, as working for the Lord, not for human masters"{" "} */}
            ‚ÄúIf a man is called to be a street sweeper, he should sweep streets even as a Michaelangelo painted, or Beethoven composed music or Shakespeare wrote poetry. 
            He should sweep streets so well that all the hosts of heaven and earth will pause to say, 'Here lived a great street sweeper who did his job well'.‚Äù{" "}
